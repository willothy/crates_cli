# crates_cli
A command line interface for finding and managing Rust crates.

Heavily inspired by cargo-edit.

### Features:
- `find` searches crates.io for a crate
- `show` displays information about a crate, including homepage and documentation links.

### Planned features:
- `add`, `rm`, and `version` for managing dependencies
- `feature` and related subcommands for managing features of dependencies
- `license` retrieve the license of a crate


### Collaboration:
Collaboration is welcome, both in the form of issues/ideas and pull requests! I'm still learning rust so feedback would be appreciated.

### Formatting
This project uses `rustfmt` for formatting, and `clippy` for linting.
